It directly duplicates the current process, creating a child that shares the same memory space initially. This method is fast and lightweight but requires manual handling of communication and synchronization between processes, and it’s not supported on Windows. On the other hand, the multiprocessing module is a high-level abstraction built into Python that works across platforms, including Windows. It simplifies process creation and management by providing built-in tools like Process, Queue, and Pipe, making it easier to share data and coordinate tasks between processes. Internally, multiprocessing may use os.fork() on Unix systems, but it also supports other methods like spawn and forkserver, depending on the operating system. So, while os.fork() offers more control and speed on compatible systems, multiprocessing is more portable, user-friendly, and suitable for complex applications.\n"

It allows you to categorize messages by severity levels such as DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL, making it easier to filter and prioritize what gets recorded. You can also direct these logs to different outputs—like the console, files, or even remote servers—and format them to include timestamps, module names, and other context.
